This is just a quick project that pulls together a few open source projects with a few tweaks to get the 
mac track pad to dispatch raw native touch events.

This project should be used as a demo or prototyping tool.  I'm not sure it's production worthy.

TO USE:

1.  Drop the .swc in the libs folder of your project.  
2.  Add the tongseng file to the root of your project. 
3.  Make sure that you set your project to run native processes.  
Add <supportedProfiles>extendedDesktop desktop</supportedProfiles> to your -app.xml file.
